-> Components: Functions defined in PascalCase.
    - 2 types of component structuring: Atomic and Feature based
    
-> Composition: Html like syntax with nested components:
    <HomePage>
        <Header />
        <Sidebar />
        <Footer />
    </HomePage>

    - Used to render nested elements in given order using prop.children special property:
    - function HomePage({ children }) {
        return {children};
      }

-> localStorage object: 
    - obj to access small storage given to each independant website
    - used to cache small amount of data to avoid api calls

-> useEffect(callback, depsArray):
    - executes callback: 
        > after each render if deps not provided.
        > only in those renders where deps changes.
        > only in the first render if deps=[].

-> x = useRef(init value or callBack that returns an init value):
    - passed to ref attribute of an element to access it like DOM
    - To store a state-like value when we do not want re-renders
    - use x.current key to access the element or value

-> useMemo(callback to calculate a value dependant on deps, depsArray): cache values.
-> useCallback(callback to return a function dependant on deps, depsArray): cache functions
-> React.memo: wrap components who are to be rendered only if their props change

-> [x, setX] useState(init value or callBack that returns an init value):
    - x is state. setX is updater. Whenever updater is executed, the components using state are re-rendered.
    - use it along with useEffect mostly to avoid infinite re-rendering loops.

-> navigate = useNavigate(): navigate func is used to redirect to routes.
-> location = useLocation(): location obj is used to get url-query params
-> params = useParams: params obj is used to get url-path params
